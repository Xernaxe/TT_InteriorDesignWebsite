# TT_InteriorDesignWebsite

    DISCLAIMER!
    At this day 26.08.22 the website is still functional but in a few months it might not be, since a good part of our website's content is uploaded on a headless CMS that I am using for educational purposes.

    #School project in which we (Me and my other 3 teammates) helped an interior designer by creating a website for her (UI/UX and technical implementation).

    #Tech stack used:
     - HTML
     - CSS
     - JavaScript
     - WordPress as a headless CMS

    #Instalation:
     Does not require any.

    #My contribution:
     My role in this project was to code the entire website and to set up WordPress (posts, categories).
